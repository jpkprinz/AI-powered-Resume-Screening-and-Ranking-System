AI-Powered Resume Screening and Ranking System This project is an AI-driven resume screening and ranking system designed to automate the hiring process by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). It helps recruiters efficiently shortlist candidates by analyzing resumes, extracting key information, and ranking applicants based on job requirements.
